[The webapp should be able to perform:

    Login functionality
    A supervisor should be able to add a project and then invite a student and other supervisors (s) to join the project.
    For each project, the supervisor should be able to add multiple boards and tasks. The tasks will have a status that shows progress.
    A schedule reminder for proposals due, task deadlines, and meetings for both students and supervisors.
    Allow the sharing of resources among students and supervisors.

The benefits of the proposed system will be:

    Minimize confusion around project assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress.
    The use of the website will save time while promoting the organization and safe access to data.
    The ability for students and supervisors to access every aspect of a projectâ€™s development with just a few clicks.
