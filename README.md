Tracking postgraduates students progress.

Problem statement: Wits post-grad students are allocated supervisors to help them during their projects. A supervisor can be allocated multiple students and they find it hard to keep track of each student’s progress, meetings, task and deadlines.

Solution: A proposed solution is a post-grad tracker website which is a collaboration tool that organizes projects into boards. In one glance, a supervisor can tell what’s being worked on, whose working on what, and the progress of each task in a project. This is achieved by linking student and supervisors to each project.

The website should be able to perform:
    A schedule reminder for proposals due, tasks deadlines and meetings for both students and supervisors.
    Allow sharing of resources among students and supervisors.

The benefits of the proposed system will be:
    Minimize confusion around projects assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress.
    Use of the website will save time while promoting organization and safe access to data.
    The ability for students and supervisors to access every aspect of a project’s development with just a few clicks.
